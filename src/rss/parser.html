                <![CDATA[Looking for someone to develop a simple chrome extension to track TV show prices for the website Vudu.com, which is a site that sells digital movies and tv shows. Looking for personal use only. May require a US based IP address to log-in. <br /><br />
    There is a specific page on the site that has a listing of over 8,000 TV shows, both individual and &amp;quot;Complete&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;bundle&amp;quot; series, which is located here: https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/uxrow/Browse-All-TV/19602<br /><br />
     At any time, there are a small percentage of shows that are on sale, and items on that page are listed as such with an orange &amp;quot;Sale&amp;quot; banner. I am looking for an extension that can grab the price of listings on that page that are both 1) &amp;quot;Complete&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;bundle&amp;quot; shows and 2) on Sale, and export to some document, possibly Excel. <br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 10, 2024 16:42 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Scripting &amp; Automation<br /><b>Skills</b>:Google Chrome Extension
